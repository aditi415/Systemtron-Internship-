         SQL Internship Overview

This repository contains my work and learning progress during my SQL internship. The internship focused on building a strong foundation in database design, data manipulation, and query optimization. Over the course of the program, I worked on practical projects involving:

1) Designing relational databases and creating Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)

2) Implementing tables with primary and foreign keys

3) Performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

4) Writing advanced SQL queries using joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, and window functions

5) Applying normalization techniques to optimize database structure

6) Gaining hands-on experience with PostgreSQL/MySQL


This experience helped me strengthen my skills in database management and apply SQL to solve real-world problems effectively.
